# HAL

A mini project by Astra Robotics utilising STM32, ROS2

## Progress

### Tasks remaining:
1. Interface IMU with STM32 using I2C (Testing required)
2. Use microros to publish acquired data to a Ubuntu environment (Publishing IMU data remaining)

### Tasks completed:
1. Interfacing of wheel encoders using ISR
2. Interfacing of IMU using I2C
3. Microros publisher for wheel encoder data
## Issues
None :)

## Updates

### Version 1.0.0 (Current)
  -> Created GitHub page\n
  -> Interfaced wheel encoders using interrupts\n
  -> Used HAL I2c functions to acquire IMU data\n
  -> Publisher of wheel enoder data complete\n
